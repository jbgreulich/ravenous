Welcome to the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

1 Creating Static Components
2 Passing Information to Components
3 Setting the State of Ravenous Components
4 Interacting with the Yelp API

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

* As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
* As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
* As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone.
